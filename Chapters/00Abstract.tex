\noindent In the pursuit of advancing marine operations, this master thesis describes a comprehensive pipeline that includes 360Â° scanning for 3D reconstruction, and robot simulation to promote safer and more efficient maritime activities. This study explores and evaluates the potential and feasibility of operator-based data collection using 360$^{\circ}$camera systems and compare it with common methods like Lidar, photogrammetry, NerF and other possible data collection solutions, to approve that 360 degree imaging eventuate in decline of 3D modeling cost in different sectors. This practice proposes and implements a novel approach that integrates and compares the use of 360 degree imaging and Lidar for point-cloud generation. Also this study mentions differences and similarities of common methods like photogrammetry and Nerf modelling from 360 degree images for creation of meshes and textured environments. Finally variety of opportunities discussed about the application and significance of low-cost point cloud generation for 3D model reconstruction in shipbuilding, building industry, safer marine operations with the help of robotic simulation.
